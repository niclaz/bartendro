## Gude: How to install Bartendro on a new machine

There are currently **two ways** in which a new user can setup a Bartendro bot using this repository: the lazy way (flashing an image onto an SD card) and the nerd way (SSH or connect a monitor to the RPI and setup Bartendro using the command line)

### THE LAZY WAY

* get a RPI 4 and an SD card (4GB at least)
* download the .img file from the [latest releases](https://github.com/MonkeyDo/bartendro/releases)
* flash the image onto the SD card using software such as Balena Etcher or Rufus
* insert SD card into RPI slot and connect to the Bartendro controll board / interface
* power up the RPI and if all goes well a new Wifi network called `bartendro` should appear that you can connect to
* After connecting a captive-portal should pop-up on your device, if not navigate to 10.0.0.10 using a web-browser
* Note: If there is no wifi network something went wrong with setup, try again and verify the SD card is well seated in the slot on RP
* Note: In this release the Wifi Country is set to ES (Spain), if you are in a different country you should run `sudo raspi-config` on the RPI to be able to change it to your current region (affects which bands the wifi uses)
* 

### THE NERD WAY

0. Preparations
*

1. Flash
* Download and write the RaspberryPi OS Lite to an SD Card - Bartendro has been tested on the following releases:
  * Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit) / Buster-armhf-lite (March 2021) - [Direct download](https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspios_lite_armhf/images/raspios_lite_armhf-2021-03-25/2021-03-04-raspios-buster-armhf-lite.zip) 
  * **TBC:** Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit) / Bullseye-armhf-lite (Aug 2021)
  * **TBC:** Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit) / Bookworm-armhf-lite (June 2023)
  * **TBC:** Raspberry Pi OS (Legacy, 32-bit) / trixie-armhf-lite (Aug 2025)
  * **TBC:** Any 64-bit version of Raspberry Pi OS / `¯\_ (ツ)_/¯  will it run?`


2. RPI related configuration
* Insert flashed SD card into RPI slot and boot the device
* SSH into the RPI **or** connect a monitor and keyboard to the RPI
* Boot the RPi and then log in as user 'pi' with password 'raspberry'
* From the command line run `sudo raspi-config`
  * Expand the filesystem
  * Set the hostname to bartendro
  * Set the Wifi Country and setup Wifi to a valid network
  * Advanced: Disable console on serial port, enable serial port
  * Advanced: Enable I2C
* IMPORTANT: reboot the RPI right after the raspi-config command `sudo reboot`

3. Running install scripts
* Once the RPI reboots fully use another device to `ssh pi@bartendro.local` (or use monitor and keyboard attached to the RPI)
* Log in again (pi/raspberry), connect to the RPI to the internet via wifi or the ethernet port, and follow these steps:

```
sudo su -
apt-get update
apt-get install -y git
git clone https://github.com/MonkeyDo/bartendro.git
```

* This may take some time to download all the files from git
```
cd scripts
sudo ./install.sh
```

* During the package install step, it will ask two questions about firewall files. Answer both with YES. (TBC)
* Once done rebooting, log into the RPi with user 'bartendro' and password 'hackme!' (TBC)
* As an additional step you can also remove the 'pi' user from sysytem by running: `sudo deluser --force --remove-home --remove-all-files pi` - if you do this step you can now you can no longer log in with the standard bartendro user with password "hackme!"
